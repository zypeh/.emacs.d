# Zypeh's Emacs Configs
## since 2012

This is an emacs configuration tree that support a number of 
programming languages.

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d. Ensure that the 'init.el'
contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el.

are not...... that might annoy people who aren't me.
